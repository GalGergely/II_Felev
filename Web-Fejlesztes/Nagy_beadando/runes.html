      <p>Conqueror provides  Amumu with a lot of what he misses and more. First off, it allows  Amumu to have a better early game (note that if you want a better chance in early duels,  Electrocute may be the way to go) since it gives him improved stats during skirmishes. Next, in the mid and late game, it allows him to be a MONSTER in extended fights, which is most of the times at this stage of the game. You will consistently heal for damage you deal, and that allows you to survive, almost like a juggernaut.
        We run  Triumph since it gives even more sustain and survivability during team fights, the person you engage on with  Bandage Toss is almost definitely dying, and  Triumph will heal you back the damage that their allies deal to you (because you're pretty much in their faces) while you reposition yourself.
        We run Tenacity so, well, quite frankly so you don't get locked down.
         Overgrowth is excellent because it allows you to scale your health (while  Conditioning scales your defenses). Another very viable option I'm testing is  Unflinching, which would help you when you engage and take a lot of damage, but given the fact  Despair stays toggled on when you are stunned, you probably don't need the Tenacity.
         Cheap Shot is nice because you get some extra damage when you engage and a ton more if you build  Rylai's Crystal Scepter as your  Despair will continuously proc this.
         Ultimate Hunter allows your most useful ability- that turns the fight around- to be up more often</p>

          <p>Aftershock gives you extra tank and damage and when you engage in a team fight with  Bandage Toss. Your  Despair with  Rylai's Crystal Scepter will help you keep enemies in range for the damage burst.
            Font of Life is good both in ganks and team fights- in ganks, you are less likely to lose an ally and furthermore more likely to get a kill down due to the heal, especially if you allies are struggling. Even though the effects seem minimal, they do really help! If you are going to be very active around the map,  Demolish may be a good option to pack punches to turrets after successful ganks and break turret plates.
            Conditioning is awesome to have despite its delay because you won't be very active before you get its effects. It adds onto your tank and allows you to peel for your carries more.

          <p>Bandage Toss,  Despair,  Tantrum +  Electrocute. More damage!! If you didn't proc it with these three, just aa.  Electrocute is relatively strong since it does a lot of damage, especially early game, and the cooldown is alright since you'll only need it for ganks. Some people run  Dark Harvest as well- I'm not completely opposed to that except that's more for one-shot builds, and it's difficult for  Amumu to be able to do this. Feel free to, however!
            Cheap Shot is nice because you get some extra damage when you engage and a ton more if you build  Rylai's Crystal Scepter as your  Despair will continuously proc this. If you can reliably land  Bandage Toss I would suggest  Sudden Impact (in other words experienced) as it allows you to deal more damage in ganks or team fights once you engage- this is for burst AP damage.
            Eyeball Collection gives you AP per kill/assist. After all, that's what you want.. right? YOU CAN SWITCH THIS OUT BASED ON PREFERENCE! Don't feel restricted to do so!
            Ultimate Hunter allows your most useful ability- that turns the fight around- to be up more often.
            Transcendence works well with  Amumu due to the CDR- you'll be popping off more  Tantrum's and more  Bandage Toss's not to mention ultimates. This does indeed mean more damage! This rune is best for a mid-game push, you can substitute this rune with: (A)  Nimbus Cloak for a gap closer in ganks and extra boost if you  Flash-R (B)  Nullifying Orb against AP threats, for a defensive option (C)  Absolute Focus or  Gathering Storm for more damage.
           In the current meta, capturing objectives (Dragon, Baron, Rift Herald) is insanely important and the  Rift Scuttler is AWESOME! Since both of these are within the river, you're more likely to be able to contest these objectives. Also many fights (both duels and team fights) will occur in the river- why not gain an advantage? Would not substitute.</p>
